### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

I'm Soham Zemse, a passionate blockchain engineer from [🇮🇳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India). Currently researching on engineering practices in DeFi, improving ÐApp experience, zero knowledge protocols and scaling with rollups while doing my M.Tech in Cryptology at [ISI Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in).
